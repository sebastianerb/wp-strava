Show your Strava activity on your WordPress site.


== Description ==

This plugin uses the Strava API to embed maps and activity for athletes and clubs on your WordPress site. Included are several widgets and shortcodes for showing maps and activity summaries.


= Shortcodes =

[activity id=NUMBER] - add to any page or post. Shows a summary of the activity plus a map if a google maps key has been added.

Also takes the following optional parameters:

* som - english/metric (system of measure - override from default setting).
* map_width - width (width of image in pixels).
* map_height - height (height of image in pixels).
* athlete_token - specify a different athlete (you can copy this value from https://www.strava.com/settings/api or the wp-strava settings page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-strava-options).
* markers - Display markers at the start/finish point (true/false, defaults to false).

[ride] - an alias for [activity] that will accept the same parameters (kept for backwards compatibility).

[route id=NUMBER] - add to any page or post. Shows a summary of the activity plus a map if a google maps key has been added.

This also takes the same optional parameters as the [activity] shortcode above.

[activities] - shows a list of recent activities the same way the "Strava Latest Activities List" does, but with a shortcode rather than a widget. Takes the following optional parameters:

* som - english/metric (system of measure - override from default setting).
* quantity - number of activities to show.
* athlete_token - specify a different athlete (you can copy this value from https://www.strava.com/settings/api or the wp-strava settings page at /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-strava-options).
* strava_club_id - Will display activity from the specified Strava club ID instead of an athlete.


= Widgets =

Strava Latest Activity List - shows a list of the last few activities.

Strava Latest Map - shows map of latest activity with option to limit latest map to activities of a certain minimum distance.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why am I getting "ERROR 401 Unauthorized"? =

When you have multiple athletes saved, the first is considered to be the default athlete. If you use a shortcode to display activity from anyone other than the default athlete, you must add the athlete token (found on the wp-strava settings page) to the shortcode, such as athlete_token=c764a2b199cff281e39f24671760c1b9c9fe005e. If you've recently had to re-authorize with Strava, your athlete token may have changed and will need to be updated in your shortcodes and widgets. For widgets, re-select the athlete you'd like to display and click Save.

= Why is my Google Map not showing up? =

If your API key works with other Google Maps plugins but not WP Strava, you may need to enable the "Static Maps" functionality on your google account. This is especially true for people using G Suite accounts (not just a @gmail.com address). While logged into your G Suite email, visit https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/static-maps-backend.googleapis.com/?q=static and make sure the "Static Maps API" is enabled. For more details see https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-data-errors/

= I recently uploaded an activity, why is it not showing on my site? =

WP-Strava caches activity for one hour so your site doesn't hit the Strava API on every page load. If you recently uploaded activity and want to see it right away, go to the Settings -> Strava in the wp-admin dashboard, check the checkbox labeled "Clear cache (images & transient data)" and then click Save Changes.
